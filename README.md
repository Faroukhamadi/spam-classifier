# Spam classification using Gradient Boosting

This is a simple example of how to use Gradient Boosting to classify spam emails. The dataset is from the spamassassin project. The dataset is available at <https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/>. The dataset is a collection of emails, each of which is labeled as spam or not spam. The goal is to train a model that can classify new emails as spam or not spam.
